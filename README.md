# Body-Tracker

## Problem Statement:
In the healthcare sector, continuous patient health monitoring is crucial for timely intervention and better patient outcomes. However, traditional monitoring systems often lack mobility and real-time data accessibility, hindering effective healthcare delivery. There is a need for an efficient and portable solution that can monitor patient health parameters remotely and alert healthcare providers in case of any abnormalities.

## Solution:
We propose the development of an IoT-based Patient Health Monitoring System using Arduino and ESP8266-01 module. This system will allow continuous monitoring of vital health parameters such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure, enabling timely medical intervention when necessary. The system will consist of the following components:

- Sensor Module: Various sensors such as pulse rate sensor, temperature sensor, and blood pressure sensor will be interfaced with Arduino to capture patient health data accurately.
- Arduino Board: Arduino will serve as the central processing unit to collect data from the sensors and transmit it wirelessly to the cloud server via the ESP8266-01 module.
- ESP8266-01 Module: The ESP8266-01 module will facilitate wireless communication between the Arduino board and the cloud server using Wi-Fi connectivity. It will transmit the collected data securely to the server in real-time.
- Cloud Server: A cloud-based platform will be deployed to receive, store, and analyze the patient health data transmitted by the Arduino board. The Cloud Server is used here is ThingSpeak.

## Benefits:

- Real-time Monitoring: Enables continuous monitoring of patient health parameters in real-time, providing healthcare providers with up-to-date information.
- Mobility: The portable design allows patients to move freely within the healthcare facility while being monitored.
- Early Detection: Alerts healthcare providers about any abnormal health patterns, facilitating timely medical intervention and improving patient outcomes.
- Remote Accessibility: Healthcare providers can remotely access patient health data via the mobile application, enabling efficient healthcare delivery even from remote locations.

Overall, the proposed IoT-based Patient Health Monitoring System offers a cost-effective, efficient, and scalable solution for continuous patient monitoring, enhancing the quality of healthcare services provided.
